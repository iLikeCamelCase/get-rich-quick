### Task List
- [] transition to hourly predictions instead of days
    - [] train model based on multiple days of data (5min interval)
- [] after learning from subset of previous days create model and display model of future predictions
    - [] compare said predictions with actual prices from those days to test validity of modelling

### Future Ideas

- Instead of attempting to predict prices for the next few days, attempt to predict the End of Day Price. Instead of Delta-x being a day, use a dataset with a Delta-x of a minute. The stock market is irrational, impossible to predict days into the future. People are also irrational, but predictable. It may be easier to learn from patterns correlating to the time of day.
